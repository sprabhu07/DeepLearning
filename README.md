## About this project

This project aims to investigate the behavior of Deep Neural Networks in relation to a image classification task by analyzing the activation of the neurons.

The images used belongs to one of the two classes:
1) Cat
2) Dog


## Project structure
The project structure is as follows:
1) dataset
This folder contains the images to be used in the project. There is a seperate folder for Cat and Dog categories.

2) images
This folder has more images compared to the dataset above. If needed, they can be moved to the dataset folder if greater number of images are needed for training.

3) visualize_localize_final
This is a .ipynb file (IPython) that has the relevant code for this project. For the code to run, the following libraries are needed:
   a) Keras  (installation steps can be found [here](https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/install_keras.html)
   b) Numpy
   c) Matplotlib
   d) Tensorflow
